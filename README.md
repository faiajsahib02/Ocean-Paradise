# Oasis — Hotel Management System

A full-stack hotel management system built with **Go** and **React + TypeScript**, designed around **Hexagonal Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, and **SOLID principles**. The codebase is intentionally structured to demonstrate clean software engineering practices: loose coupling, dependency injection, and clear separation of concerns across every layer.

---

## Architecture

The backend follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**, keeping the domain core completely isolated from external concerns like HTTP, databases, or third-party APIs. Each layer depends only on abstractions — never on concrete implementations.

```
React + TypeScript (Frontend)
        |
        | HTTP / WebSocket
        v
REST Handlers  +  Middleware (JWT, CORS)
        |
        | calls via interface (Port)
        v
Service Layer — business logic, one bounded context per module
        |
        | depends on repository interface, not implementation
        v
Repository Layer — data access adapters
        |
        | sqlx
        v
PostgreSQL
```

---

## Design Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The backend is divided into **8 bounded contexts**, each owning its domain model, service, and repository. Domain entities live in `domain/` and are plain Go structs with no framework dependencies — they model the business, nothing else.

```
domain/
  guest.go          # Guest entity — check-in, check-out, profile
  room.go           # Room entity — status: vacant / occupied / cleaning
  invoice.go        # Invoice entity — aggregates charges across services
  housekeeping.go   # Housekeeping task entity
  laundry.go        # Laundry request + items
  restaurant.go     # Menu items and orders
  staff.go          # Staff profiles and roles
```

Naming reflects the business language directly — `CheckInDate`, `RoomStatus`, `InvoicePreview` — not database column names or HTTP fields.

### Hexagonal Architecture — Ports & Adapters

Each module exposes a **Port** (interface) and provides an **Adapter** (implementation). HTTP handlers and repositories both connect to the domain through these interfaces, making every component independently replaceable and testable.

```go
// port.go — defines what the module can do (the contract)
type Service interface {
    Create(room domain.Room) (*domain.Room, error)
    Find(roomNumber string) (*domain.Room, error)
    GetAll(status string) ([]domain.Room, error)
}

// service.go — implements the contract, depends on a repository interface
type service struct {
    rmRepo RoomRepo
}

func NewService(rmRepo RoomRepo) *service {
    return &service{rmRepo: rmRepo}
}
```

The HTTP handler depends on `room.Service` (the interface), not the concrete `service` struct. The repository is also behind an interface. Neither the handler nor the service ever imports a concrete type from the other layer.

### Dependency Injection

All dependencies are wired once at startup in `cmd/serve.go` using **constructor-based injection**. No service creates its own dependencies. No global state. The dependency graph is explicit and fully controlled.

```go
// cmd/serve.go — full DI composition root
db         := infra.NewConnection(cfg)
roomRepo   := repository.NewRoomRepo(db)
roomSvc    := room.NewService(roomRepo)
roomHandler := roomhandler.NewHandler(roomSvc)
```

This means every component can be tested in isolation by injecting a mock — the business logic is never coupled to a real database or HTTP layer.

### Loose Coupling

- Handlers depend on service **interfaces**, not implementations
- Services depend on repository **interfaces**, not concrete types
- Domain entities have zero dependencies on any external package
- No circular imports — the dependency flow is strictly one-directional

Swapping PostgreSQL for another database, or replacing the REST layer with gRPC, would require changes only at the adapter level — the domain and service logic remain untouched.

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | Each service owns exactly one bounded context. Handlers translate HTTP, services apply business rules, repositories access data — each does one thing. |
| **Open / Closed** | New behaviour is added by implementing existing interfaces, not by modifying existing services. |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Any repository implementation can replace another without breaking the service that depends on it. |
| **Interface Segregation** | Each module defines a small, focused interface exposing only what its consumers actually need. |
| **Dependency Inversion** | High-level modules (services) depend on abstractions (interfaces). Low-level modules (repositories) implement those abstractions. |
